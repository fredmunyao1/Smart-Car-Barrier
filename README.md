**1.0 Introduction**
In this task, we will create an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) based car barrier system to demonstrate the control of vehicle flow in car parking lots and parking garages.
1.1 Working of the Prototype
The barrier will be raised when there is a vehicle within the detectable area and will be lowered when there is no vehicle in front of the barrier. Ultrasonic sensors are particularly suitable for controlling this process. They detect objects regardless of vehicle type, size, or color and monitor the entire area below the barrier.

**1.2 Collaborative Task**
Draft a sketch for the smart barrier and request the Team handling 3D printing to print out the final design for implementation.

**1.3 Objectives**
What Will I Learn?
You will learn the basic working principle of how an ultrasonic sensor works.
You will learn how to use the ultrasonic sensor with a servo motor.
You will learn how digital input and output work using the ultrasonic sensor and the servo motor as the output.
